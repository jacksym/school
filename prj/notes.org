* mtng2

- region of bright -- long tail -- constant brightness -- distribution
- reported uncertainties right order?
- modification 
- certain distributions with additional parameters
- how does it change with the magnitude of the source
- find something like the median scatter/how the distribution goes whether the larger deviations ovvur more or less frequently than a normal distribution would suggest
- two ways of looking at photometric measurements: (symmetric?)
  - times series of magnitude measurements
  - star flux's measurements
  - skew? -- which more closely resembles the symmetry in a normal distribution
- sytematically?
- using parametric models -- how many paramaters?
- null hypothesis: photometric data -- matches normal distribution
- different distribution?
- data indication --> want a distribution with larger probabilities in the tail?
  - detect small deviation -- function of measured data
  - normal distribution --> very low probability of large deviation from center value
  - things that pop up in the data that contradict the assumption that though you do independent measurements, they follow a Gaussian distribution
  - there is one distribution that gives everything between normal and Gaussian distribution: Student T distribution
- the idea is rather than looking at the origin you look at the tails
- bending angle is twice the Schwarzchild radius divided by the impact parameter (for weak gravitational fields)


* mtng3

- divide by error bar -- match unit gaussian?
  - distribution more tail-heavy?
- symmetry
  - how does distribution look like if consider uncertainty in measured magnitude
  - flux's vs magnitude?
- bright star vs faint star
  - corrections to errorbars
- correlations? ogle data vs moa data
- cumulative distributions
- what are the characterisics of a gaussian distribution/student t-dist
- average the flux/magnitude for individual seasons rather than all
  - issue with calibration (within a given year, the data offsets)
    
* mtng4

- look at the distribution:
  - take the measured data point - mean value / error bar
  - sort the deviations --> correlative plotj


* mtng5
ps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov_test

- you have the distribution: look at the integral over the residual distribution
- distribution plot:
  - take the measured magnitude
  - subtract average
  - divide by the quoted errorbar
  - take the absolute value of that
- cumulative distribution function
- derivative of -- one is the logarithm of the other
- roughly the errorbar in one is absolutely the errorbar in the other
  
- how does the cumulative distriution look for a standard gaussian/(and others)

* mtng6

Do you see any discrepencies between the standard dice Gaussian with respect if you take the original errorbars. And you do a KS test.
    - fluxes and magnitude
    - studet t-dist
    - fit additional parameter
    - modify the Gaussian distribution
      - to think that the reported errorbar, but the size is not right
    - either scale up the errorbar or add something to it
      - make a new errorbar that is the old one squared + the correction term 
	- (accounts for systematic error)
    - stars with various brightness
    - whether the correction factors can be used uniformly across magnitudes
    - paramaterize the factors as a function of magnitude
    - all of the statistics of the data analysis assume there is a certain probabliity for a data point to deviate
